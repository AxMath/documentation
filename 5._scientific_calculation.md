# 5. Scientific Calculation

## Calculation Trigger

AxMath supports algebraic calculus, including exponential and logarithmic functions, trigonometric functions,  permutation and combination and many other calculations. It's capable of replacing the desktop calculator and it's WYSIWYG. AxMath enables calculation via trigger key and the results will fill in automatically. For example:

$$ d = 32 $$
$$ A = \frac{\pi d^2}{4} $$

When you press the trigger key (by default is "=") at the end of 2nd line, AxMath will calculate the result of A for you and fill it after the "=". The outcome becomes:

$$ d = 32 $$
$$ A = \frac{\pi d^2}{4} = 804.24771932 $$

In the upper case, the first line defines variable $$$d$$$, and the second line $$$\pi$$$ is the constant.

When you only need to edit the formula instead of using the calculation, you can press (setup button), and in the "Calculator" panel you can turn off this utility.
